Result
------
The python program is found in the file exercise_5.1.py

Method
------
The python program defines two functions, complement() and reverse_complement().

The complement() function computes the complement of a nucleotide. 

The reverse_complement function calls the complement() function and computes 
the reverse complement of a sequence.

The python program requires the users to give a command-line input, calls the 
reverse_complement()function, and prints out the reverse complement of the primer. 

Strengths 
------------------------
The program can handle upper and lower-case primers. 

If the users type in some invalid characters, the program will report the error 
as 'ERROR: Invalid Primer'.
