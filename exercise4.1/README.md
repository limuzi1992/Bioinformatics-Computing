Result
------
The python program is found in the file exercise_4.1.py

Method
------
The python program defines two functions, complement() and reverse_complement().

The complement() function computes the complement of a nucleotide. 

The reverse_complement function calls the complement() function and computes 
the reverse complement of a sequence.

The python program requires the users to enter the codon, calls the reverse_complement()
function, and prints out the reverse complement of the codon. 

Strengths 
------------------------
The program allows the users to enter the codons they are interested in. 
And the program can handle both upper and lower-case codons.

Weaknesses
------------------------
If the users type in some invalid characters, the program will fail to report the error.
