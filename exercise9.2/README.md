Result
------

The python program is found in the file exercise_9.2.py

Method
------

The python program is used to print out the frequency of each nucleotide in 
a DNA sequence in most-occurrences to least-occurrences order.

The python program requires the users to input a DNA sequence file on the command line.

The program builds a dictionary whose keys are the symbols in the DNA sequence and values 
are the frequency of each symbol.

Strengths 
------------------------

The program can output all symbols and their frequency not only the four nucleotides.

Weaknesses
------------------------

The program will treat a upper-case letter and its lower-case letter as different symbols.

What I have learned from the exercise
------------------------

In this exercise, I practiced how to use the sorted and lambda functions.
